# AtXml 

XML Parser library written in C++. Developed from scratch using C++ standard libraries.

Code::Blocks project is included which should compile without much difficulty. Some examples and documentation can be found in the 'resources' folder.

This library is no longer in development but served its purpose to parse and interpret User Interface structures stored in XML for a C++ project.
